/**
 * In this exercise we're going to create an example class named Animal,
 * instantiate a new instance of it, and print it out to the console.
 *
 * All of the class files for this project can be found in the /src/main/java
 * project folder. You should see two files, Animal.java and Main.java. Remember
 * that IntelliJ doesn't show the extension for Java files.
 *
 * To complete this exercise, follow the instructions in the Animal class and
 * this Main class.
 *
 * In this class, in the main method, create a new instance of the class Animal
 * using the new keyword and store it in a variable. Print the instance of
 * Animal to the console.
 *
 * Follow the instructions in javadoc comments below.
